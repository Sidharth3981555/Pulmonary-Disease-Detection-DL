Large-scale public chest X-ray dataset curated by the NIH Clinical Center for medical imaging research. 
Contains 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images in PNG format.
Images are sourced from 30,805 unique patients. 
Each image is annotated with up to 14 common thoracic disease labels using natural language processing (NLP) of radiology reports. 
Multi-label dataset:
              A single X-ray can have multiple disease labels.
              Also includes the “No Finding” (normal) class. 
Typical disease labels include Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Edema, Effusion, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Hernia, Infiltration, Mass, Nodule, Pleural Thickening, Pneumonia, Pneumothorax.
Images are usually ~1024 × 1024 pixels, allowing detailed feature extraction.
Comes with metadata such as:
               Patient ID
               Age
               Gender
               View position (PA/AP) 
Widely used for:
               Multi-label disease classification
               Model benchmarking
               Automated detection research in deep learning
